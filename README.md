# Clustering-Service-Area-of-Different-Flying-Base-Station-Located-at-the-same-Depot

Done as part of my Master's thesis. 

The use of drones as flying base stations to provide connectivity in wireless networks has
been explored in recent years. However, to maximise efficiency, a careful planning of drone
trajectories is of paramount importance. In this project, given an arbitrary set of nodes for
drones to visit, I aim to develop a clustering algorithm to help decide what nodes each drone
visits. This clustering algorithm is an expansion on the already existing Kmeans++. This
algorithm was then validated with MATLAB’s built–in function for Kmeans++ to show the
potential of the new program.
